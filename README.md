# Link Prediction Research Project

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying network organization links into categories such as continuous, missed, new, and no links. The goal is to predict the status of network links based on various features.

## Role and Contributions
As a Graduate Research Assistant, my responsibilities included:
- **Data Cleaning and Processing**: Ensured the data was clean and well-structured for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracted and engineered features to enhance model performance.
- **Model Experimentation**: Tested various classification models to find the most effective ones.
- **Documentation**: Prepared documentation and presentation materials for client and academic review.
- **Presentation**: Presented progress and findings to clients and professors.
- **Co-authoring**: Contributed to the research paper detailing the project's outcomes.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is linked below. It contains network link data used for classification tasks.

## Preprocessing
The preprocessing steps involved:
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed missing values and handled outliers.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features to improve model performance.

## Classification Models
The following models were evaluated:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Support Vector Machine**
- **Gradient Boosting Machines**

## Results
The results of the model evaluations and comparisons can be found in the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory.
